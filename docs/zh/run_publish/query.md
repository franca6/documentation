# Query your Project using GraphQL

::: info Coming from the Graph?

You may want to take a look at the information we have [on the differences](../build/graph-migration.md#graphql-query-differences) between SubQuery's GraphQL library, and The Graph.

您可以在这里关注 [官方GraphQL指南](https://graphql.org/learn/) 来了解 GraphQL的更多消息、工作原理及应用方法：

- There are libraries to help you implement GraphQL in [many different languages](https://graphql.org/code/) - we recommend [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) as it will allow a [seamless migration to our decentralised network](../subquery_network/publish.md#changes-to-your-dapp) when you publish your project in the future.
- You will want to review advice on how to [structure your GraphQL queries to maximise performance](../build/optimisation.md#query-performance-advice).
- 关于实用教程的深入学习体验，请参阅 [如何GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/)。

On the top right of the playground, you'll find a _Docs_ button that will open a documentation draw. 该文档是自动生成的，可帮助您查找实体和方法。 On our [Managed Service Explorer](https://explorer.subquery.network/), you will also find a query constructor.
